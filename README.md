# GIT-PROJECT
This python code provides a comprehensive code into how we can utilize machine learning to 
predict stock prices. However this code is a dummy code. This is because no actual stock prices were 
analyzed. However, this code displays efficient use of machine learning techniques such as cross validation, linear regression
scikit-learn and some useful statistics. In due course actual stock price data will be used specifically from S&P 500 stock data from 
3 decades ago.
